## About Me

I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at ETH Zürich, specializing in **Machine Intelligence** and **Data Management**. My expertise lies at the intersection of data science and software engineering, where I apply my skills in **Python**, **machine learning**, and **big data technologies** to create impactful solutions. I am driven by a passion for solving real-world problems and enjoy collaborating on projects that leverage data for predictive analytics and optimization.

I have strong practical experience in data engineering, machine learning, and forecasting, having contributed to open-source projects like the [Darts forecasting library](https://github.com/unit8co/darts) and developed tools for industries ranging from logistics to energy. I’m always keen to explore new challenges, especially in **Data Science**, **Software Engineering**, or **Data Engineering** roles.

Feel free to connect or reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss potential projects!
